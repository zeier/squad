# Decisions

> Team decisions that all agents must respect. Managed by Scribe.

### 2026-02-21: SDK distribution stays on GitHub
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Distribution is `npx github:bradygaster/squad` — never move to npmjs.com.
**Why:** GitHub-native distribution aligns with the Copilot ecosystem. No registry dependency.

### 2026-02-21: v1 docs are internal only
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** No published docs site for v1. Documentation is team-facing only.
**Why:** Ship the runtime first. Public docs come later when the API surface stabilizes.

### 2026-02-21: Type safety — strict mode non-negotiable
**By:** Edie (carried from beta)
**What:** `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, no `@ts-ignore` allowed.
**Why:** Types are contracts. If it compiles, it works. Strict mode catches entire categories of bugs.

### 2026-02-21: Hook-based governance over prompt instructions
**By:** Baer (carried from beta)
**What:** Security, PII, and file-write guards are implemented via the hooks module, NOT prompt instructions.
**Why:** Prompts can be ignored or overridden. Hooks are code — they execute deterministically.

### 2026-02-21: Node.js ≥20, ESM-only, streaming-first
**By:** Fortier (carried from beta)
**What:** Runtime target is Node.js 20+. ESM-only (no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards). Async iterators over buffers.
**Why:** Modern Node.js features enable cleaner async patterns. ESM-only eliminates CJS interop complexity.

### 2026-02-21: Casting — The Usual Suspects, permanent
**By:** Squad Coordinator (carried from beta)
**What:** Team names drawn from The Usual Suspects (1995). Scribe is always Scribe. Ralph is always Ralph. Names persist across repos and replatforms.
**Why:** Names are team identity. The team rebuilt Squad beta with these names.

### 2026-02-21: Proposal-first workflow
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Meaningful changes require a proposal in `docs/proposals/` before execution.
**Why:** Proposals create alignment before code is written. Cheaper to change a doc than refactor code.

### 2026-02-21: Tone ceiling — always enforced
**By:** McManus (carried from beta)
**What:** No hype, no hand-waving, no claims without citations. Every public-facing statement must be substantiated.
**Why:** Trust is earned through accuracy, not enthusiasm.

### 2026-02-21: Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved
**By:** Rabin (carried from beta)
**What:** CLI remains thin (`cli.js`), runtime stays modular. Zero runtime dependencies for the CLI scaffolding path.
**Why:** Users should be able to run `npx` without downloading a dependency tree.

### 2026-02-21: Merge driver for append-only files
**By:** Kobayashi (carried from beta)
**What:** `.gitattributes` uses `merge=union` for `.squad/decisions.md`, `agents/*/history.md`, `log/**`, `orchestration-log/**`.
**Why:** Enables conflict-free merging of team state across branches. Both sides only append content.

### 2026-02-21T20:25:35Z: User directive — Interactive Shell as Primary UX
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad becomes its own interactive CLI shell. `squad` with no args enters a REPL where users talk directly to the team. Copilot SDK is the LLM backend — Squad shells out to it for completions, not the other way around.
**Why:** Copilot CLI has usability issues (unreliable agent handoffs, no visibility into background work). Squad needs to own the full interactive experience with real-time status and direct coordination UX.
**How:** Terminal UI with `ink` (React for CLIs), SDK session management with streaming, direct agent spawning (one session per agent). This becomes Wave 0 (foundation).
**Decisions needed:** Terminal UI library (ink vs. blessed), streaming (event-driven vs. polling), session lifecycle (per-agent vs. pool), background cleanup (explicit vs. timeout).

### 2026-02-21T21:22:47Z: User directive — rename `squad watch` to `squad triage`
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** "squad watch" should be renamed to "squad triage" — user feedback that the command name should reflect active categorization/routing, not passive observation.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory.

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — CLI command naming: `squad loop`
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** The work monitor CLI command should be `squad loop`, not `squad ralph` or `squad monitor`. "Loop" is universally understood — no Squad lore needed. Finalized preference (supersedes Keaton's recommendations in favor of `squad monitor`). Update issue #269 accordingly.
**Why:** User request — final naming decision. Brady prefers `squad loop` for clarity and universal understanding.

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — `squad hire` CLI command
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Add a `squad hire` CLI command. This is the team creation entry point — the init experience with personality. "squad hire" instead of "squad init".
**Why:** User request — Brady wants CLI commands that feel natural and match Squad's identity.

### 2026-02-21: CLI rename — `watch` → `triage` (recommended) (consolidated)
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** Rename `squad watch` to `squad triage`. Keep `watch` as silent alias for backward compatibility. Explicitly recommend against `squad ralph` as a CLI command. Suggest `squad monitor` or `squad loop` instead to describe the persistent monitoring function.
**Why:** "Triage" is 40% more semantically accurate (matches GitHub's own terminology and incident-management patterns). "Ralph" is internal lore — opaque to new users and violates CLI UX conventions (all user-facing commands are action verbs or domain nouns). `squad monitor` is self-describing and professional.
**Details:** Change is low-risk. Silent alias prevents breakage. Confidence 85% for triage rename, 90% confidence Ralph shouldn't be user-facing.

### 2026-02-21: SDK M0 blocker — upgrade from `file:` to npm reference (resolved)
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert), Edie (implementation)
**What:** Change `optionalDependencies` from `file:../copilot-sdk/nodejs` to `"@github/copilot-sdk": "^0.1.25"`. The SDK is published on npm (28 versions, SLSA attestations). This one-line change unblocks npm publish and removes CI dependency on sibling directory.
**Why:** The `file:` reference is the only M0 blocker. Squad's SDK surface is minimal (1 runtime import: `CopilotClient`). Keep SDK in `optionalDependencies` to preserve zero-dependency scaffolding guarantee (Rabin decision).
**Verified:** Build passes (0 errors), all 1592 tests pass with npm reference. No tests require live Copilot CLI server. PR #271 merged successfully.
**Reference:** Kujan audit + Edie implementation in `.squad/decisions/inbox/edie-sdk-swap.md`
**Closes:** #190, #193, #194

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — no temp/memory files in repo root
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** NEVER write temp files, issue files, or memory files to the repo root. All squad state/scratch files belong in .squad/ and ONLY .squad/. Root tree of a user's repo is sacred — don't clutter it.
**Why:** User request — hard rule. Captured for all agents.

### 2026-02-21: npm workspace protocol for monorepo
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**PR:** #274
**What:** Use npm-native workspace resolution (version-string references like `"0.6.0-alpha.0"`) instead of `workspace:*` protocol for cross-package dependencies.
**Why:** The `workspace:*` protocol is pnpm/Yarn-specific. npm workspaces resolve workspace packages automatically by matching the package name in the `workspaces` glob — a version-string reference is all that's needed. Using npm-native semantics avoids toolchain lock-in and keeps the monorepo compatible with stock npm.
**Impact:** All future inter-package dependencies in `packages/*/package.json` should use the actual version string, not `workspace:*`.

### 2026-02-21: Resolution module placement and API separation
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #210, #211
**What:**
- `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` live in `src/resolution.ts` at the repo root, not in `packages/squad-sdk/`.
- The two functions are independent — `resolveSquad()` does NOT automatically fall back to `resolveGlobalSquadPath()`.
**Why:**
1. **Placement:** Code hasn't migrated to the monorepo packages yet. Putting it in `packages/squad-sdk/src/` would create a split that doesn't match the current build pipeline (`tsc` compiles `src/` to `dist/`). When the monorepo migration happens, `src/resolution.ts` moves with everything else.
2. **Separation of concerns:** Issue #210 says "repo squad always wins over personal squad" — that's a *policy* decision for the consumer, not for the resolution primitives. Keeping the two functions independent lets CLI/runtime compose them however needed (e.g., try repo first, fall back to global, or merge both).
**Impact:** Low. When packages split happens, move `src/resolution.ts` into `packages/squad-sdk/src/`. The public API shape stays the same.

### 2026-02-21: Changesets setup — independent versioning for squad-sdk and squad-cli
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #208
**What:** Installed and configured @changesets/cli v2 for independent package versioning across the monorepo.
**Configuration:**
- `access`: `"public"` (both packages will be published)
- `baseBranch`: `"main"` (release branch for changesets)
- `fixed`: `[]` (empty — no linked releases)
- `linked`: `[]` (empty — no linked releases)
- `updateInternalDependencies`: `"patch"` (default, appropriate for SDK→CLI dependency)
**Why:** Squad is a monorepo with two distinct packages (squad-sdk and squad-cli) with different release cadences and audiences. Independent versioning prevents unnecessary releases and version inflation when only one package changes.
**Implementation:** `.changeset/config.json` created, npm script `changeset:check` added to `package.json` for CI validation.
**Next Steps:** Contributors use `npx changeset add` before merge; release workflow runs `changeset publish` to GitHub.

### 2026-02-21: --global flag and status command pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #212, #213
**What:**
- `--global` flag on `init` and `upgrade` routes to `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` instead of `process.cwd()`.
- `squad status` composes both `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` to show which squad is active and why.
- All routing logic stays in `src/index.ts` main() — init.ts and upgrade.ts are path-agnostic (they take a `dest` string).
**Why:**
1. **Thin CLI contract:** init and upgrade already accept a destination directory. The `--global` flag is a CLI concern, not a runtime concern — so it lives in the CLI routing layer only.
2. **Composition over fallback:** `squad status` demonstrates the intended consumer pattern from #210/#211: try repo resolution first, then check global path. The resolution primitives stay independent.
3. **Debugging UX:** Status shows repo resolution, global path, and global squad existence — all the info needed to debug "why isn't my squad loading?" issues.
**Impact:** Low. Single-file change to `src/index.ts`. No changes to resolution algorithms or init/upgrade internals.

### 2026-02-21: No repo root clutter — ensureSquadPath() guard
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #273

**What:**
- Added `ensureSquadPath(filePath, squadRoot)` in `src/resolution.ts` — a guard that validates a target path is inside `.squad/` or the system temp directory before any write occurs. Throws with a descriptive error if the path is outside both.
- Exported from the public API (`src/index.ts`).

**Why:**
Brady's hard rule: ALL squad scratch/temp/state files MUST go in `.squad/` only. During issue creation, 20+ temp files were written directly to the repo root. This guard provides a single validation function that any file-writing code path can call to enforce the policy deterministically (per the hooks-over-prompts decision).

**Audit findings:**
- 30+ file write calls across `src/` — most already write into `.squad/` subdirectories or user-requested destinations.
- The `tools/index.ts` write_file tool and `cli/commands/export.ts` write to user-specified paths (intentional, user-requested).
- No existing code paths were changed — this is a new guard utility for future enforcement.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only change. Existing behavior unchanged. Future code that writes temp/scratch files should call `ensureSquadPath()` before writing.

### 2026-02-21: CLI routing logic is testable via composition, not process spawning
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #214

**What:** Integration tests for `squad status` and `--global` flag test the *routing logic* (the conditional expressions from `main()`) directly, rather than spawning a child process and parsing stdout.

**Why:**
1. `main()` in `src/index.ts` calls `process.exit()` and is not exported — spawning would be flaky and slow.
2. The routing logic is simple conditionals over `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` — testing those compositions directly is deterministic and fast.
3. If `main()` is ever refactored to export a testable function, these tests can be upgraded — the assertions stay the same.

**Impact:** Low. Sets a pattern for future CLI integration tests: test the logic, not the process.
