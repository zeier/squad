# Decision: StreamBridge is an event sink, not a subscriber

**What:**
`StreamBridge` receives `StreamingEvent` objects via `handleEvent()` but does not register itself with `StreamingPipeline`. The wiring (`pipeline.onDelta(e => bridge.handleEvent(e))`) is the caller's responsibility.

**Why:**
1. **Testability:** The bridge can be tested with plain event objects — no pipeline instance needed.
2. **Flexibility:** The shell entry point controls which events reach the bridge (e.g., filtering by session, throttling for UI frame rate).
3. **Single responsibility:** The bridge translates events to callbacks; it doesn't manage subscriptions or lifecycle.

**Impact:** Low. Pattern applies to all future bridges between the pipeline and UI layers (ink components, web sockets, etc.).
