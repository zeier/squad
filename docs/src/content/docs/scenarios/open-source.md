# Squad for Open Source Projects

**Try this to onboard as a contributor:**
```
Help me contribute to this open source project — review their CONTRIBUTING.md and set up a team
```

**Try this to automate maintainer tasks:**
```
Enable auto-triage for incoming issues on my OSS repo
```

**Try this to handle contributor-friendly tasks:**
```
Handle good-first-issue #42 autonomously
```

Squad helps OSS maintainers with autonomous issue triage, contributor guidance, and architectural knowledge sharing. Reduces maintainer burden while keeping quality high.

---

## 1. The Open Source Maintainer Problem

Autonomous issue triage, community contributor support, and architectural knowledge sharing.

You maintain an open source project. Issues pile up. PRs from new contributors need guidance. Questions repeat. Triaging takes hours.

Squad helps:
- **Triage incoming issues** automatically
- **Guide contributors** with documented patterns
- **Handle good-first-issue tasks** autonomously
- **Keep architecture decisions visible** in `.ai-team/decisions.md`

---

## 2. Install Squad and Set Up Triage

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-open-source-lib
npx github:bradygaster/squad
```

Enable the Ralph heartbeat workflow:

```bash
cp .ai-team-templates/squad-heartbeat.yml .github/workflows/
git add .github/workflows/squad-heartbeat.yml
git commit -m "Enable Squad auto-triage"
git push
```

Ralph now runs every 6 hours, reading new issues and applying labels:

```
Issue #142: "Add support for custom themes"
  → squad:trinity (frontend work)
  → type:feature
  → priority:medium

Issue #143: "Documentation typo in README"
  → squad:scribe (docs work)
  → type:docs
  → priority:low
  → good-first-issue
```

---

## 3. Community Contributors File Issues, Squad Triages

A contributor files an issue:

```
Issue #144: "Add TypeScript type definitions"
```

Ralph (heartbeat workflow) reads the issue, applies:
- `squad:morpheus` (backend/tooling work)
- `type:feature`
- `priority:high`
- `good-first-issue` (if it's suitable)

You review triaged issues and add `go:morpheus` if you approve.

---

## 4. @copilot Picks Up Good-First-Issue Tasks Autonomously

Enable the auto-assign workflow:

```bash
cp .ai-team-templates/copilot-auto-assign.yml .github/workflows/
git add .github/workflows/copilot-auto-assign.yml
git commit -m "Enable Squad auto-assign"
git push
```

When you add `go:morpheus` to issue #144, GitHub Actions triggers:

```
GitHub Actions → Copilot session spawns Morpheus
Morpheus reads issue #144 → implements TypeScript definitions
Morpheus opens PR #145 → "Add TypeScript type definitions"
```

You review PR #145, approve, merge. Issue #144 closed.

**The contributor filed the issue. Squad handled it.**

---

## 5. Skills Document Your Project's Patterns

After Squad works on your project for a few weeks, `.ai-team/skills/` becomes a **living contributor guide**:

`.ai-team/skills/testing-conventions.md`:

```markdown
# Testing Conventions

All new features must include tests. Use Jest for unit tests.

Test file naming: `{module}.test.ts`
Test structure: describe → it blocks
Mock external dependencies with `jest.mock()`
```

Contributors can **read this file** to understand your testing norms. No need to repeat it in every PR review.

`.ai-team/skills/api-design-patterns.md`:

```markdown
# API Design Patterns

All API endpoints follow RESTful conventions:
- GET for read operations
- POST for create
- PUT for full update
- PATCH for partial update
- DELETE for removal

Use HTTP status codes correctly:
- 200 OK for success
- 201 Created for resource creation
- 400 Bad Request for invalid input
- 404 Not Found for missing resources
- 500 Internal Server Error for server issues
```

**These skills are contributor documentation** that stays up to date because agents use them.

---

## 6. Decisions.md is Your Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

`.ai-team/decisions.md` becomes your **public ADR**:

```markdown
### 2025-07-10: Use esbuild instead of Webpack
**By:** Neo
**What:** Migrated build system from Webpack to esbuild
**Why:** 10x faster builds, simpler config, better DX for contributors

### 2025-07-12: Stick with CommonJS for now
**By:** Neo
**What:** Not migrating to ESM yet
**Why:** Too many compatibility issues with downstream tools
       Will revisit in 6 months

### 2025-07-15: Use Zod for runtime validation
**By:** Morpheus
**What:** All API input validation uses Zod schemas
**Why:** Type-safe, composable, generates TypeScript types
```

Contributors see **why you made decisions**, not just what the code does.

---

## 7. Export Your Squad for Forks

When someone forks your project, they can **import your squad**:

```bash
npx github:bradygaster/squad export
```

Share `squad-export-{date}.zip` in your repo's releases or documentation.

Forkers import it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/forker/my-lib-fork.git
cd my-lib-fork
npx github:bradygaster/squad import squad-export-2025-07-15.zip
```

Now they have **your team's knowledge** — skills, decisions, conventions. They're not starting from scratch.

## 8. Sample Prompts for Open Source Workflows

**Triage a batch of issues:**

```
> Ralph, triage the 15 newest issues. Apply squad labels based on
> routing rules. Flag any that are duplicates or need clarification.
```

**Check which issues are ready for autonomous work:**

```
> Show me all issues labeled good-first-issue and squad:morpheus.
> Which ones are clear enough for Morpheus to handle autonomously?
```

**Autonomous issue processing:**

```
> Issue #152 is labeled go:morpheus. Morpheus, implement the feature,
> write tests, and open a PR.
```

**Generate contributor documentation from skills:**

```
> Scribe, create a CONTRIBUTING.md file based on our accumulated
> skills and conventions. Include testing patterns, code style,
> and PR guidelines.
```

**Review contributor PRs:**

```
> Neo, review PR #160 from @contributor. Check if it follows our
> conventions (skills, decisions). If not, suggest changes.
```

**Handle a repeat question:**

```
> Issue #175 is asking how to add a custom validator again.
> Scribe, write a skill file for this so we can point future
> contributors to it.
```

## 9. Label Your Repo as Squad-Enabled

Add a badge to your README:

```markdown
## Contributing

This project uses [Squad](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad) for AI-assisted development.

- **Triaging:** Issues are auto-labeled by Squad's Ralph agent
- **Patterns:** See `.ai-team/skills/` for coding conventions
- **Decisions:** See `.ai-team/decisions.md` for architectural rationale
- **Import the squad:** `npx github:bradygaster/squad import squad-export.zip`
```

Contributors know what to expect.

## Tips

- **Ralph triages issues for you.** Run the heartbeat workflow every 6 hours to auto-label new issues.
- **Skills are living contributor docs.** As your squad learns, `.ai-team/skills/` becomes a knowledge base contributors can read.
- **Decisions.md is your ADR.** Architectural decisions are visible and explained, not hidden in Git history.
- **Export your squad for forks.** Forkers get your team's accumulated knowledge — skills, conventions, decisions.
- **good-first-issue + go:* = autonomous processing.** Mark issues as safe to auto-process, and Squad handles them.
- **Agents don't merge without approval.** PRs created by agents still require human review before merging.
