# Human Team Members

> ⚠️ **Experimental** — Squad is alpha software. APIs, commands, and behavior may change between releases.


**Try this to add a human specialist:**
```
Add Sarah (sarah@example.com) as a frontend developer to the team
```

**Try this to add a human reviewer:**
```
Add Jordan as design reviewer
```

Not every team member needs to be AI. Add real people to the roster for decisions that require a human — design sign-off, security review, product approval.

## Adding a Human

```
> Add Sarah as design reviewer
```

Sarah appears in the team roster with a 👤 Human badge, distinct from AI agents.

## How Humans Differ from AI Agents

| | AI Agent | Human Member |
|---|----------|-------------|
| Badge | Role-specific emoji | 👤 Human |
| Charter | ✅ | ❌ |
| History | ✅ | ❌ |
| Spawned as sub-agent | ✅ | ❌ |
| Can review work | ✅ | ✅ |

Human team members have no charter, no history file, and are never spawned as sub-agents. They exist on the roster as routing targets.

## What Happens When Work Routes to a Human

When the coordinator determines that a task should go to a human team member:

1. **Squad pauses** and tells you that a human needs to act
2. You relay the task to the person outside of Squad
3. When they respond, you tell Squad what happened

If the human hasn't responded after a while, Squad sends **stale reminders** prompting you to follow up.

## Humans as Reviewers

Human team members can serve as reviewers in the [reviewer protocol](../concepts/your-team.md#reviewer-protocol). This is useful when you want a real person to sign off before work is considered done.

```
> Add Jordan as security reviewer
```

When work requires security review, Squad routes it to Jordan and waits.

---

## Removing a Human

Same as removing any team member — they move to alumni:

```
> Remove Sarah from the team
```

Their entry moves to `.squad/agents/_alumni/`. They can be re-added later.

## Tips

- Use human members for approval gates — design review, compliance, final sign-off.
- Human members work well alongside [ceremonies](ceremonies.md) — add a human as a required participant in a design review ceremony.
- You're the relay. Squad can't message humans directly — it tells you, and you coordinate.

```

Unblocks work that was waiting on human input.

```

```
