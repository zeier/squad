# Squad Is Now Public

Squad, the AI agent team framework for GitHub Copilot, moves from private repo to public distribution on npm.

## What Is Squad?

**AI agent teams for any project.** Describe what you're building. Get a team of specialists — lead, frontend, backend, tester, DevRel — that live in your repo, learn your codebase, and persist across sessions. Not a chatbot. A real team.

## What Changed

| | Before | Now |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Repository | Private (bradygaster/squad-pr) | **[Public](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad)** |
| Distribution | `npx github:bradygaster/squad` (removed) | `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` |
| Versioning | Git commits | Semantic versioning (v0.8.18) |
| Packages | Monolithic `@bradygaster/create-squad` | **Separate:** `@bradygaster/squad-cli` + `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` |

## Get Started in 3 Commands

```bash
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli
squad init
copilot
```

Then in Copilot: `/agent` → select **Squad** → describe your project.
