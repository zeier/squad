- Marketplace foundation

### M5 — Sharing & Marketplace

## Breaking Changes

| Change | Migration |
|--------|-----------|
| Config file: `squad.agent.md` → `squad.config.ts` | Run `squad init` to generate typed config |
| Team dir: `.squad/` | Standard directory for all team state |
| Routing: markdown rules → typed `RoutingRule[]` | Export existing rules with `squad export` |
| Models: string names → tier-based `ModelConfig` | Use `defaultTier` + `fallbackChains` in config |

## Migration Instructions

1. **Install**: `npm install @bradygaster/squad@0.6.0`
2. **Init**: `npx squad init` — generates `squad.config.ts` from existing setup
3. **Verify**: `npx squad status` — confirms config loads and agents resolve
4. **Test**: Run your project's test suite to confirm no regressions
5. **Finalize**: Ensure `.squad/` contains all required team state files

## Test Summary

- **1400+** automated tests (vitest)
- **5** manual test scripts
- Config migration, legacy fallback, export/import roundtrip all verified

## Known Limitations

- Only English locale supported in v1 (i18n infrastructure in place)
- Marketplace is read-only in this release (publish coming in v0.7)
- Offline mode is best-effort; some features require network
